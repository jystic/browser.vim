Installation of the browser.vim plugin
======================================

1. Requirements

This plugin is mostly written in perl, so you need a perl-enable vim version  
to use it. In addition, the perl modules HTML::FormatText, LWP::UserAgent and 
URI from cpan are required.  One way to install these modules is by running:

    cpan LWP::UserAgent

etc.

The plugin was tested on linux, with vim 6.3 and perl 5.8.4.

2. Installation

There are two sub-directories, 'vim' and 'perl'. The contents of the 'vim' 
directory should be copied to some directory on the runtimepath. The contents 
of the 'perl' directory should be copied either to a directory on the perl 
search path, or to a subdirectory named 'perl' of a directory in the 
runtimepath.

3. Documentation

The vim help file is in the doc subdirectory. Don't forget to run :helptags 
after copying it (see :help add-local-help for details).

This help file is generated from browser.pod in the current directory. You 
may use it to view the documentation from the command line, as in

    perldoc browser.pod

That's it!
