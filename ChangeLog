* Version 0.2

Main Improvements:
	- Added forms support. All input kinds are supported except for 
	  textarea, file and multiple choice options. Thus, eg, google can be 
	  used
	- Made less system dependent. No known system dependent parts remain.  
	  Most features should now work on any platform. Partially tested on 
	  windows, thanks to Suresh Govindachar.
	- A command line (perl) script, 'vimbrowse.pl', now allows lunching 
	  vim as a browser from the command line.
	- Numerous bugs were fixed.

Incompatible changes:
	- All the plugin's related data is now kept in one directory, 
	  specified by g:browser_data_dir. In particular, if 
	  g:browser_addrbook_dir is not explicitly set, the bookmarks 
	  directory now resides in that directory.
	- The default command names were changed to contain the prefix 
	  'Browser', to reduce the risk of incompatibility with other plugins.  
	  The original (shorter) commands can be restored by installing 
	  plugin/browser_short.vim from the 'extra' directory.
