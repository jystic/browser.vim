This plugin provides vim with web browsing and html formatting capabilities. 
It includes support for history, bookmarks, text highlighting and more. The 
main motivation is browsing documentation available in html, so don't expect 
to see any flash animation :)

The plugin is implemented using vim's ability to embed perl, so you will 
need to have a perl enabled version of vim to use it. In addition, several 
perl modules are required. The full details are in the INSTALL file.

Documentation is available in pod form in 'browser.pod', and as a usual vim 
help file.

I wrote and tested it with vim version 6.3 and perl 5.8.4 on linux. I expect 
it to work on any variant of unix. An effort was made to make it work on other 
platforms as well, but this remains mostly untested.

Please send me any feedback.

Enjoy!
